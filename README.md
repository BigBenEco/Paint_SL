# Paint_SL
A Repository dedicated to my sophomore year java class program.
This class project is to make a simple paint program. It is a super lab, meaning it's our major project/program for this class.
This may be shared with a partner, we just need to figure that part out of how to collaborate over git hub.
I am starting this as a place to record my starting ideas of how to organize the project.

Setup complete, for further information about understanding this repository, go to Paint_SL>Project Organization>Physical Layout Glossator.txt to understand what is going an and where to find things.
